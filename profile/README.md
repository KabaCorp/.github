## A Quick Overview

Kaba is the secure platform that will transform the way we think about personal computers and security. At Kaba we use a techique called "Bi-directional Isolationâ„¢" to create a software airgap as our prevention foundation. You *no* longer need *slow virtual machines* to run applications that could be a threat.

The plan is to build the most Secure, Dveloper firendly, and Enterprise ready workspace. A workspace that doesn't depend on anything physical
or even the operating system Kaba is running on. 

We are looking for fellow sientists to join us on a mission of prevention. Using our current knowleadge and technology; cybersecurity prevention is not only possible but steps away. Join us if you love any of these: AI, Security, Web Technologies, WebASM, Containers, Genetic Engineering, CRISPR or even just playing Chess. **jobs@kabacorp.com** No degree or level of education nessesary - just skill, motivation (provided in part by us with equity) and determination.
